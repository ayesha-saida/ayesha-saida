## Hi there 👋, I'm Ayesha

I build full stack applications using React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Firebase.
This GitHub profile is my **learning diary** - a place where I learn, apply, and create through real projects.


## 🧠 About Me

- 🌱 Improving my skills daily through real-world projects
- 🧪 I learn by **doing** - experimenting, breaking things, and fixing them
- 📌 All my projects here are part of my growth journey
